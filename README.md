# Public Cloud technical documentation
This is a single location for all technical/developer documentation for product teams working on the Public Cloud Platform.

Visit the deployed Gatsby site at [docs.developer.gov.bc.ca](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/). See how that's deployed at the [private-cloud-techdocs](https://github.com/bcgov/platform-developer-docs/tree/07904f54dc36c33db156145945be6c00b62483d2) repo.

# Documentation
Markdown documents are located in `./docs` with related images in `./images`.

In progress (not yet published) documents are located in `./drafts`.

Please see [Writing guide for Platform Services technical documentation](https://github.com/bcgov/platform-developer-docs/blob/07904f54dc36c33db156145945be6c00b62483d2/tech-docs-writing-guide.md) for documentation formatting and contribution information.

Start your new document from the new [Markdown document template](/new-markdown-document-template.md).

# Deploy locally
To deploy locally you need to have Node.js installed. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). You will also need to have Docker installed. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

After you have Node.js and Docker installed, you can follow these instructions to [preview content locally](https://github.com/bcgov/devhub-techdocs-publish/blob/main/docs/index.md#how-to-use-the-docker-image-to-preview-content-locally). A browser should open with an un-themed, but formatted version of the documentation. This closely resembles what will be visible on the end product.

## Windows Users
If you are using Windows, the command provided in the instructions will not work. You have 2 options, either execute a modified command (listed below) from a PowerShell terminal, or execute the command from a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) terminal.

> NOTE: The site will not auto-launch in your browser. You will need to click on the link provided in the terminal output (ie. http://localhost:3000).

**PowerShell Terminal Command:**
```powershell
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -v ${PWD}:/github/workspace ghcr.io/bcgov/devhub-techdocs-publish preview
```

**WSL Terminal Command:**
```wls
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 $(pwd):/github/workspace ghcr.io/bcgov/devhub-techdocs-publish preview
```

> NOTE: If you are executing the command from a WSL terminal, you will need to have the repository cloned into your WSL environment.
