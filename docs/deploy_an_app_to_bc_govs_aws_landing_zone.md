## First H2 content heading in sentence case
1. Introduction
### First H3 content heading
- Brief overview of the BC Government AWS SEA environment.
The AWS Accelerator is a tool designed to help deploy and operate secure multi-account, multi-region AWS environments on an ongoing basis. The power of the solution is the configuration file that drives the architecture deployed by the tool. This enables extensive flexibility and for the completely automated deployment of a customized architecture within AWS without changing a single line of code.
Deploys an opinionated and prescriptive architecture designed to help meet the security and operational requirements of many governments around the world (initial focus was the Government of Canada).â€‹The Cloud Pathfinder team has added additional automation, and functionality to meet the needs of the Government of BC

3. Defining your Infrastructure using Terraform
### Fourth H3 content heading
- What is Terraform
Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. 
Sample app(AWS CloudFront and S3)

4. Configuring GitHub Action OIDC Authentication to AWS

### Fifth H3 content heading
- Explanation of using OpenID Connect (OIDC) for GitHub Action authentication to AWS.
Open ID Connect (OIDC) is a set of protocols that simplifies the authorization process between
two entities that trust each other. When configuring in AWS to use OIDC the first requirement is to have the OIDC component available. When creating the project set for the different ministry teams, the Cloud Pathfinder Team (CPF) adds the OIDC component to the list of components available in AWS to the ministry teams so it is ready for use. The ministry teams are responsible to configure their AWS and GitHub environments to use OIDC

5. Using S3 and DynamoDB for Terraform State

### Nineth H3 content heading
- Introduction to Terraform state management.

### Tenth H3 content heading
- Explanation of using Amazon S3 and DynamoDB for storing Terraform state files.
Using Amazon S3 and DynamoDB for storing Terraform state files is a best practice approach to managing and maintaining the state of your infrastructure as code deployments. Terraform is a tool for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure resources, and its state files keep track of the current state of the resources it manages.

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable and durable object storage service, while Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service. Combining these two services with Terraform helps ensure the reliability, security, and collaboration of your infrastructure deployments. Here's how it works:
S3 for Storing State Files:
When Terraform runs, it generates a state file that reflects the current state of your infrastructure. This state file is crucial because it helps Terraform understand what resources are already deployed, what changes need to be made, and what resources need to be created, modified or destroyed.
DynamoDB for Locking:
When Terraform runs, it reads the current state file to determine the existing resources. During this process, it also locks the state to prevent concurrent modifications by multiple users. This is important to avoid conflicting changes and potential resource corruption
### Eleventh H3 content heading
- Walkthrough of setting up S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for Terraform state storage.

### Twelveth H3 content heading
- How to configure Terraform to use the S3 and DynamoDB backend.
