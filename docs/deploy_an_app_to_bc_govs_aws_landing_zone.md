## Introduction

### Brief overview of the BC Government AWS SEA environment.
The AWS Accelerator is a tool designed to help deploy and operate secure multi-account, multi-region AWS environments on an ongoing basis. The power of the solution is the configuration file that drives the architecture deployed by the tool. This enables extensive flexibility and for the completely automated deployment of a customized architecture within AWS without changing a single line of code.
Deploys an opinionated and prescriptive architecture designed to help meet the security and operational requirements of many governments around the world (initial focus was the Government of Canada).â€‹The Cloud Pathfinder team has added additional automation, and functionality to meet the needs of the Government of BC

### Explanation of the project-set concept: dev, test, prod, and tools AWS accounts.
The concept of project-set, which includes different AWS accounts for development (dev), testing (test), production (prod), and tools, is a best practice used to organize and manage resources and workloads in an AWS (Amazon Web Services) environment. This approach helps ensure separation, security, and isolation of environments while also improving resource management, access control, and collaboration. Here's an explanation of each of these AWS accounts within a project-set:

Development (Dev) AWS Account:

The Development account is where software engineers and developers work on new features and code changes. It is the earliest stage in the software development lifecycle.
Key characteristics:
Developers have the freedom to experiment and test without affecting the production environment.
It may contain multiple environments for different feature branches or teams.
Resources in this account should be isolated from production to prevent accidental disruptions.
Testing (Test) AWS Account:

The Testing account is where quality assurance (QA) engineers and testers validate and verify the functionality of the application.
Key characteristics:
It mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.
Testers can perform various types of testing, such as functional, load, and security testing.
Data and configurations should be as close to the production environment as possible to ensure accurate testing.
Production (Prod) AWS Account:

The Production account is the live environment where the application or service is accessible to end-users.
Key characteristics:
Strict access controls and monitoring are in place to maintain a highly secure and stable environment.
It is critical to minimize changes and disruptions to this environment to ensure high availability and reliability.
Disaster recovery and backup mechanisms should be well-defined in case of outages.
Tools AWS Account:

The Tools account is a separate AWS account used for various operational and tooling purposes.
Key characteristics:
It may include resources for CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment), monitoring, logging, automation, and management.
It is isolated from the other accounts to prevent tool-related issues from affecting the dev, test, or prod environments.
Provides a centralized location for common tools and services used across the project-set.

###  Purpose of the technical documentation.

List of prerequisites for deploying the app, such as AWS accounts, permissions, and tools.

## Defining your Infrastructure using Terraform

### What is Terraform
Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. 
Sample app(AWS CloudFront and S3)

## Configuring GitHub Action OIDC Authentication to AWS

### Explanation of using OpenID Connect (OIDC) for GitHub Action authentication to AWS.
Open ID Connect (OIDC) is a set of protocols that simplifies the authorization process between
two entities that trust each other. When configuring in AWS to use OIDC the first requirement is to have the OIDC component available. When creating the project set for the different ministry teams, the Cloud Pathfinder Team (CPF) adds the OIDC component to the list of components available in AWS to the ministry teams so it is ready for use. The ministry teams are responsible to configure their AWS and GitHub environments to use OIDC

## Using S3 and DynamoDB for Terraform State

### Introduction to Terraform state management.

### Explanation of using Amazon S3 and DynamoDB for storing Terraform state files.
Using Amazon S3 and DynamoDB for storing Terraform state files is a best practice approach to managing and maintaining the state of your infrastructure as code deployments. Terraform is a tool for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure resources, and its state files keep track of the current state of the resources it manages.

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable and durable object storage service, while Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service. Combining these two services with Terraform helps ensure the reliability, security, and collaboration of your infrastructure deployments. Here's how it works:
S3 for Storing State Files:
When Terraform runs, it generates a state file that reflects the current state of your infrastructure. This state file is crucial because it helps Terraform understand what resources are already deployed, what changes need to be made, and what resources need to be created, modified or destroyed.
DynamoDB for Locking:
When Terraform runs, it reads the current state file to determine the existing resources. During this process, it also locks the state to prevent concurrent modifications by multiple users. This is important to avoid conflicting changes and potential resource corruption

### How to configure Terraform to use the S3 and DynamoDB backend.

## Writing GitHub Action Workflows

### Overview of GitHub Actions and their importance in the deployment process.
GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

### How to run a Terraform Plan from your local development environment
To run a Terraform plan from your local development environment, you need to have Terraform, AWS CLI and VScode(most widely used) installed and properly configured.You also need to have the reqired permission to deploy to AWS, Copy and paste credentials from AWS login for the respective account, commands into your shell to set up your AWS CLI environment variables. Here are the steps to run a Terraform plan:

Install Terraform:
If you haven't already installed Terraform on your local development environment, you can download the latest version from the official Terraform website [terraform install](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Initialize Your Terraform Configuration:
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your Terraform configuration files are located. Use the `terraform init` command to initialize Terraform. This step downloads any required providers and sets up your working directory.

Run Terraform Plan:
Now, you can run the `terraform plan` command to generate an execution plan based on your configuration. The plan command provides a preview of the changes that Terraform will make to your infrastructure

Review the Plan:
Terraform will display a summary of the changes it intends to make. This includes resources to be created, modified, or deleted. Carefully review the plan to ensure it aligns with your expectations and requirements.

Apply the Plan:
If you are satisfied with the plan and want to apply the changes to your infrastructure, you can use the `terraform apply` command. Be cautious when applying changes, especially in a production environment, as it can make significant modifications.
