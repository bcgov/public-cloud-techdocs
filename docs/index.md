# Welcome to the Public cloud Technical Documentation

Last updated: **{{ git_revision_date_localized }}**

## Overview

This documentation provides information for using Public cloud services within the B.C. government. It covers both [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](#amazon-web-services-aws-lza) and [Microsoft Azure](#microsoft-azure) platforms, offering resources for [provisioning project sets](#provision-a-project-set), and for designing, building, and deploying applications in these environments. Whether you're new to cloud or an experienced developer, you'll find valuable information to help you navigate the B.C. government's Public cloud environment.

## Provision a Project Set

To get started in the Public cloud you can provision a Project Set in AWS or Azure using the [Platform Product Registry](https://registry.developer.gov.bc.ca).

For more information, see [Provision a Project Set](welcome/provision-a-project-set.md).
