### Platform community MeetUps

Every six weeks, we host a platform community MeetUp where we talk about changes to the platform.

### Reusable code and services

We have several [sample applications](deploy_an_app_to_bc_govs_aws_landing_zone.md#sample-applications) where you can deploy a simple application into your AWS Accounts utilizing different architectures. Use these to learn about best practices, pipeline interactions with AWS, and give your team a launchpad to begin development in AWS.
