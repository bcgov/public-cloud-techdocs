# Welcome to the Public Cloud Technical Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides information for using public cloud services within the BC Government. It covers both **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and **Microsoft Azure** platforms, offering resources for provisioning project sets, designing, building, and deploying applications in these environments. Whether you're new to cloud computing or an experienced developer, you'll find valuable information to help you navigate the BC Government's public cloud infrastructure.

## Provision a project set

To get started in the public cloud you can provision a project set in AWS or Azure using the [Product Registry](https://registry.developer.gov.bc.ca).

For more information, see [Provision a project set in AWS or Azure](get-started/provision-a-project-set.md).

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)

AWS offers a broad set of global cloud-based products including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security, and enterprise applications.
