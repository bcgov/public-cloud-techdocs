### Rocket.Chat

Rocket.Chat will be your main communication channel for platform updates and support while you work in the BC Gov Private Cloud PaaS. Read about [how to stay connected in Rocket.Chat](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/cloud/services/public/get-support/#contact).

[Log in to Rocket.Chat](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca).

### Platform community MeetUps

Every six weeks, we host a platform community MeetUp where we talk about changes to the platform.

[Learn how to register for this and other events](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/cloud/services/public/get-support/#contact).

### Reusable code and services

We have several [sample applications](deploy-an-app-to-bc-govs-aws-landing-zone.md#sample-applications) which will deploy a simple application into your AWS Accounts utilizing different architectures. Use these to learn about best practices, how a GitHub Actions pipeline interacts with an AWS account in the SEA, and give your team a launchpad to begin development in AWS.
