# Welcome to the Public cloud AWS Technical Documentation

Last updated: **{{ git_revision_date_localized }}**

## Get started with AWS

Start here for the first steps on working in our AWS Secure Environment Accelerator (ASEA):

* [B.C. government AWS Landing Zone overview](get-started-with-aws/bc-govs-aws-landing-zone-overview.md)
* [Provision a project set in AWS](../../welcome/provision-a-project-set.md)
* [Account access](../../welcome/provision-a-project-set.md#accessing-your-project-set)

## Build, deploy and maintain apps

Best practices on the platform:

* [Requirements for building your application](design-build-and-deploy-an-application/requirements-for-building-your-application.md)
* [Deploy an application to the  B.C. government AWS Landing Zone](design-build-and-deploy-an-application/deploy-an-app-to-the-aws-landing-zone.md)
* [Networking](design-build-and-deploy-an-application/networking.md)

<!--
Make sure to keep the page titles with the exact name of pages throughout the documentation

E.g "Deploy an application to the  B.C. government AWS Landing Zone" cannot be called Build and deploy an application" as well.  This helps avoid any confusion to the user and our naming  through our public tech docs

* Maintain an application (coming soon) 
* Retire an application (coming soon)

## Understand your AWS billing

Use the Cost Management Dashboard to get an overview of your spend in AWS:

* [AWS billing and cost management dashboards](understanding-your-aws-bill/aws-billing-and-cost-management-dashboard-via-quicksight.md)

<!-- ## Training and learning

Relevant technical information about the components that make up the AWS Secure Environment Accelerator (ASEA). -->

<!-- ### Learn about the AWS Secure Environment Accelerator (ASEA) -->
<!-- * [Technical architecture](technical-architecture.md) -->
<!-- * [Networking](design-build-and-deploy-an-application/networking.md) -->



### Reusable code and services

We have several [sample applications](design-build-and-deploy-an-application/deploy-an-app-to-the-aws-landing-zone.md#sample-applications) which will deploy a simple application into your AWS Accounts utilizing different architectures. Use these to learn about best practices, how a GitHub Actions pipeline interacts with an AWS account in the ASEA, and give your team a launchpad to begin development in AWS.
