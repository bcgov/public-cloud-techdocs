# AWS Enterprise Support

Last updated: **{{ git_revision_date_localized }}**

Once your Project Set has been provisioned in the AWS Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA), the AWS Account will be enrolled in the AWS Enterprise Support. Only the Production AWS Account will be enrolled in the AWS Enterprise Support.

## Filing AWS support tickets

You can file AWS support tickets directly from the AWS console in your production account:

1. **Access the AWS Support Center**: In the AWS console, click on the **Support** menu in the top navigation bar
2. **Create a new case**: Select "Create case" to start a new support ticket
3. **Choose case type**: Select the appropriate case type:
   - **Technical** for infrastructure, service, or configuration issues
   - **Account and billing** for account-related questions
   - **Service limit increase** for requesting higher service quotas
4. **Provide details**: Fill in the required information including:
   - Service affected
   - Severity level (Critical, High, Normal, Low)
   - Subject and description
   - Any relevant logs or error messages
5. **Submit and track**: Once submitted, you can track the progress of your case in the Support Center
