## Your project set structure

When you're provisioned in LZA, you receive a project set consisting of four AWS accounts:

```
Project Set (abc123)
â”œâ”€â”€ Development Account (abc123-dev)
â”œâ”€â”€ Test Account (abc123-test)
â”œâ”€â”€ Production Account (abc123-prod)
â””â”€â”€ Tools Account (abc123-tools)
```

Each account serves a specific purpose in your application lifecycle, providing clear separation between environments.

## Accessing your AWS accounts

Once your project set is provisioned and you have the appropriate permissions, you can access your AWS accounts through the AWS SSO Portal:

**ðŸ”— [Access AWS SSO Portal](https://bcgov.awsapps.com/start/#/?tab=accounts)**

### First-time access

1. Navigate to the [AWS SSO Portal](https://bcgov.awsapps.com/start/#/?tab=accounts)
2. Sign in with your IDIR credentials
3. You'll see a list of available AWS accounts based on your assigned roles
4. Click on the account you want to access
5. Choose your role (if you have multiple roles assigned)
6. You'll be redirected to the AWS Management Console

### User roles and access

LZA uses five predefined roles with different levels of access:

- **Viewers**: Read-only access to AWS resources
- **Developers**: Administrative access to dev, test, and tools accounts
- **Admins**: Full access to all accounts including production
