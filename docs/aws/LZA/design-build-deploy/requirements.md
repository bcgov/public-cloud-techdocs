# Requirements for building your application in AWS LZA

Last updated: **{{ git_revision_date_localized }}**

The following sections describe the requirements for building your application on the B.C. government Public cloud AWS Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA).

!!! info "About AWS LZA"

    AWS Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA) is the current solution for secure, compliant AWS cloud environments in BC Government. It provides a standardized, well-architected foundation for building and deploying applications in AWS with built-in security guardrails and compliance controls.

## Prerequisites

1. **Create a provisioning request**: Submit a [provisioning request for a Project Set](../../../welcome/provision-a-project-set.md) for your team on the B.C. government Public cloud.

2. **Wait for provisioning**: Once approved, your Project Set will be provisioned, followed by an email sent to the Product Owner and Technical Lead(s) once the provisioning is complete.

3. **Manage user access**: Learn how to manage team access by reviewing [User Management in AWS LZA](user-management.md).

!!! tip "Getting started quickly"

    Once your Project Set is provisioned, you can immediately access your AWS accounts through the [AWS SSO Portal](https://bcgov.awsapps.com/start/#/?tab=accounts) using your IDIR credentials.

## Limitations of the AWS Landing Zone Accelerator

Take the following into consideration when building your application in the AWS Landing Zone Accelerator:

### Network connectivity
- **No direct government network access**: There is no direct (private) connectivity to the B.C. government network. Applications requiring access to government network data must use public endpoints.
- **Cross-account network isolation**: The Tools account VPC does not have network connectivity to Dev, Test, or Prod VPCs. Cross-account deployments are limited to AWS API operations only.
- **HTTPS requirement**: Only HTTPS applications are compatible with public endpoints through Amazon API Gateway or Application Load Balancer.

!!! note "Direct Connect coming soon"

    Direct Connect is planned to provide private connectivity to the B.C. government network in the future.

### Regional and infrastructure constraints
- **Regional limitations**: Only Canada (Central) - `ca-central-1` region is supported.
- **Platform-managed networking**: VPCs and subnets are managed by the platform and cannot be created or modified by users. Security groups are the exception and can be managed by users.
- **IAM User restrictions**: IAM Users and their access keys can only be generated by the [IAM User management service](iam-user-service.md), which is created and managed by the Public cloud team.

### Permission synchronization
- **User access timing**: After user permissions are granted or modified, it can take up to 40 minutes for changes to synchronize across all AWS accounts in your Project Set.

!!! warning "Plan for permission delays"

    When onboarding new team members or changing permissions, factor in the 40-minute synchronization window for access changes to take effect.

## Development requirements and best practices

To effectively develop and deploy applications on AWS LZA, follow these requirements:

### CI/CD and deployment
- **Use infrastructure as code**: Deploy using tools like Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, or AWS CDK.
- **Implement CI/CD pipelines**: Use automated deployment pipelines for consistent and reliable deployments.
- **OIDC authentication**: For GitHub Actions deployments, configure [OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication](deploy-to-the-aws-landing-zone-accelerator.md).

### Monitoring and cost management
- **Set up monitoring**: Implement monitoring solutions for your applications using AWS CloudWatch or other monitoring tools.
- **Configure budget alerts**: Through the [Product Registry](https://registry.developer.gov.bc.ca/login), configure budgets to receive notifications when your spending approaches limits.

### Security and access control
- **Principle of least privilege**: Only grant access to AWS accounts for users who actually need it.
- **Use appropriate roles**: Leverage the five predefined roles (Viewers, Developers, Admins, Billing viewers, Security auditors) based on user responsibilities.
- **Secure secrets management**: Use AWS Secrets Manager or Systems Manager Parameter Store for sensitive configuration data.

!!! tip "Start small and iterate"

    Begin with simple deployments to understand the platform limitations and gradually build more complex infrastructure as your team becomes familiar with LZA.

## Local development setup

To facilitate local development and deployments to AWS LZA, you'll need the following tools:

### Required tools
1. **Terraform**: Install by following the [official Terraform guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
2. **AWS CLI**: Install using the [AWS CLI installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
3. **Visual Studio Code**: Set up using the [VSCode setup guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)

### AWS CLI configuration

Configure AWS CLI to work with your LZA accounts:

1. **Access credentials**: Obtain temporary credentials from the [AWS SSO Portal](https://bcgov.awsapps.com/start/#/?tab=accounts)
2. **Configure AWS CLI with SSO**: See [AWS CLI SSO configuration guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/sso-configure-profile-token.html)

```bash
aws configure sso
```
