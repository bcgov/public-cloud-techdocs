Last updated: **{{ git_revision_date_localized }}**

Many of the ministry teams are exploring AWS AI services to build intelligent applications. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are rapidly evolving technologies. The following are recommendations and guidance based on AWS best practices and the specific configurations available in the B.C. government's AWS Landing Zone Accelerator.

!!! tip "AWS AI best practices"

    Be sure to review AWS's comprehensive AI and ML best practices documentation, which covers architectural considerations, security measures, governance strategies, and operational excellence for AI workloads.

    AWS provides detailed guidance on responsible AI development, model governance, and MLOps practices:

    - [AWS AI/ML best practices and design patterns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/machinelearning-pattern-list.html)
    - [AWS Well-Architected Machine Learning Lens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/machine-learning-lens/welcome.html)
    - [AWS Responsible AI practices](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/responsible-ai/)

## Region availability and model limitations

All AWS AI services are available in the Canada Central (`ca-central-1`) region, which is the only supported region in AWS LZA. However, there are important limitations regarding AI model availability:

!!! warning "Model marketplace restrictions"

    **Important**: The public AWS marketplace for AI models is **not available** in the BC Government AWS environment. This significantly limits the foundation models that can be used with Amazon Bedrock.

    **Currently available models**:
    - **Amazon Titan models** (Text, Embeddings, Image, Multimodal)
    - **Mistral models** (Mistral 7B, Mixtral)

    Popular models like Anthropic Claude, Meta Llama, Cohere, and others available in the public marketplace **cannot** be used in this environment.

Before starting development, verify that your required AI models are available within these constraints. If you need access to additional models, contact the [Public Cloud Service Desk](https://citz-do.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3) to discuss options.

## Deploying AI services securely

When deploying AWS AI services in the LZA environment, follow these security best practices:

### VPC and network configuration
- Deploy AI services within your VPC when possible
- Configure appropriate [security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-groups.html) to restrict access

### Access and authentication
- Use [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) instead of access keys
- Implement [least privilege access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
- Use [AWS STS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html) for temporary credentials

### Data protection
- Encrypt data at rest using [AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/)
- Encrypt data in transit using TLS
- Store sensitive configuration in [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/) or [Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html)

!!! example "SageMaker deployment example"

    When deploying Amazon SageMaker in a private network, ensure you configure:
    
    - VPC endpoints for SageMaker API, Runtime, and Notebook instances
    - Private subnets for training and inference instances
    - Proper security group rules for notebook access
    - S3 VPC endpoint for model artifacts and data storage

    For detailed guidance, see [Amazon SageMaker in VPC documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/infrastructure-connect-to-resources.html).
