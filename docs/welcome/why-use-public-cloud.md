It meets the needs and compliance requirements of the B.C. government. Teams develop applications in a secure and well-governed environment. The OCIO's Landing Zones offers several significant benefits:

1. **Enhanced security compliance**: It aligns with high-standard security frameworks like [NIST 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final) and the [Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity (CCCS) Medium](https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/annex-4a-profile-1-protected-b-medium-integrity-medium-availability-itsg-33) Cloud Control Profile, which is crucial for government applications handling sensitive, Protected B data. This compliance ensures that your applications meet the necessary security standards, providing peace of mind for both developers and stakeholders.

2. **Streamlined development process**: The platform automates cloud environment setup. This lets ministry teams focus on developing applications instead of managing infrastructure. Your team can develop faster without worrying about foundational setup.

3. **Customizable and scalable architecture**: It gives you the freedom to customize the cloud architecture for your project, supporting a variety of application patterns. Whether you're working on small projects, or large complex applications, it adapts to meet your needs.
