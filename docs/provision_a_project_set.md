# Provision a new AWS project set

On the Public Cloud platform, different teams organize their work in isolated project sets. Before you can work on the platform, you need to submit a project provisioning request to have a project set provisioned for you on the BC Gov Public Cloud. Aditinally your team will have to fill out and sign an MOU, all of which and more will be brought up durring your onboarding session with our team.

Each new request must be reviewed and approved, including requests for additional projects from teams that already have one or more projects on the platform.
