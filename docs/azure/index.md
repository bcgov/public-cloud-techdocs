# Welcome to the Public Cloud Azure Technical Documentation

## Get started

Start here for the first steps on working in our Azure Landing Zone (ALZ):

* [B.C. Government Azure Landing Zone overview](get-started/bc-govs-azure-landing-zone-overview.md)
* [Provision a project set](../get-started/provision-a-project-set.md)
* [User management in Azure](design-build-and-deploy-an-application/user-management.md)

## Build, deploy and maintain apps

Best practices on the platform:

* [Requirements for building your application](design-build-and-deploy-an-application/requirements-for-building-your-application.md)
* [Deploy an application to the B.C. Government Azure Landing Zone](design-build-and-deploy-an-application/deploy-an-app-to-the-azure-landing-zone.md)
* [Networking](design-build-and-deploy-an-application/networking.md)

<!--
Make sure to keep the page titles with the exact name of pages throughout the documentation

E.g "Deploy an application to the  B.C. Government Azure Landing Zone" cannot be called Build and deploy an application" as well.  This helps avoid any confusion to the user and our naming  through our public tech docs

* Maintain an application (coming soon) 
* Retire an application (coming soon)

### Rocket.Chat

Rocket.Chat will be your main communication channel for platform updates and support while you work in the BC Gov Public Cloud. Read about [how to stay connected in Rocket.Chat](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/cloud/services/public/get-support/#contact).

If you already have access, you can
[log in to Rocket.Chat](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca).

### Public Cloud Community Update 

Every six weeks, we host a public cloud community update where we talk about changes to the platform.

[Learn how to register for this and other events](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/cloud/services/public/get-support/#contact).

### Reusable code and services
<!--
We have several [sample applications](design-build-and-deploy-an-application/deploy-an-app-to-the-aws-landing-zone.md#sample-applications) which will deploy a simple application into your AWS Accounts utilizing different architectures. Use these to learn about best practices, how a GitHub Actions pipeline interacts with an AWS account in the ASEA, and give your team a launchpad to begin development in AWS.
