# Welcome to the Public Cloud Azure Technical Documentation

## Get started

Start here for the first steps on working in our Azure Landing Zone (ALZ):

* [Azure Landing Zone Overview](get-started/bc-govs-azure-landing-zone-overview.md)
* [Provision a Project Set](../get-started/provision-a-project-set.md)
* [User Management in Azure](design-build-and-deploy-an-application/user-management.md)

## Build, deploy and maintain apps

Best practices on the platform:

* [Requirements for building your application](design-build-and-deploy-an-application/requirements-for-building-your-application.md)
* [Deploy an application to the B.C. Government Azure Landing Zone](design-build-and-deploy-an-application/deploy-an-app-to-the-azure-landing-zone.md)
* [Networking](design-build-and-deploy-an-application/networking.md)

<!--
Make sure to keep the page titles with the exact name of pages throughout the documentation

E.g "Deploy an application to the  B.C. Government Azure Landing Zone" cannot be called Build and deploy an application" as well.  This helps avoid any confusion to the user and our naming  through our public tech docs

* Maintain an application (coming soon) 
* Retire an application (coming soon)

<!-- ### Learn about the AWS Secure Environment Accelerator (ASEA) -->
<!-- * [Technical architecture](technical-architecture.md) -->
<!-- * [Networking](design-build-and-deploy-an-application/networking.md) -->

### Reusable code and services

PENDING: We are working on providing reusable code and services to help you build your applications. Stay tuned for updates.

* Container-based application: [Azure Startup Sample Application (Containers)](https://github.com/bcgov/azure-startup-sample-app-containers)
* Serverless-based application: [Azure Startup Sample Application (Serverless)](https://github.com/bcgov-c/ecf-azure-startup-sample-app-serverless)

<!--
We have several [sample applications](design-build-and-deploy-an-application/deploy-an-app-to-the-aws-landing-zone.md#sample-applications) which will deploy a simple application into your AWS Accounts utilizing different architectures. Use these to learn about best practices, how a GitHub Actions pipeline interacts with an AWS account in the ASEA, and give your team a launchpad to begin development in AWS.
