## Microsoft Cost Management

Microsoft Cost Management is a suite of FinOps tools that help organizations analyze, monitor, and optimize their Microsoft Cloud costs. You can access Cost Management within the billing and resource management experiences or separately as a standalone tool optimized for FinOps teams who manage cost across multiple scopes.

Within the Azure portal, navigate to the [Cost Management - Cost Analysis](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_CostManagement/Menu/costanalysis) view. This service provides a centralized view of the costs of your Azure environments.

!!! example "View Scope"
    Please make sure that you select the appropriate **Scope** to view the costs of your environment.
