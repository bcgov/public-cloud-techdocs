Last updated: **{{ git_revision_date_localized }}**

Once your Project Set has been provisioned, each Azure Subscription will be enrolled in the Azure Unified Support plan. There is a delay of approximately **2 weeks** for the Azure Unified Support plan to be activated.

!!! info "Third-party vendor landing zones"
    If you use a third-party vendor's landing zone in Azure, you cannot use the B.C. Government's Unified Enterprise Support plan.

    Ministry teams working in the OCIO-managed Landing Zone in Azure can currently access the Unified Enterprise Support services for free. 

You can view the full list of services available to the ministries under the [Unified Enterprise Support plan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-IN/microsoft-unified/plan-details){:data-proofer-ignore}.

## How to receive support

1. Log into [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your IDIR. Only users with access to applications in the OCIO-managed Landing Zone can use the Unified Enterprise Support plan.
