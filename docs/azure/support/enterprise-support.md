# Microsoft Azure Enterprise Support

Last updated: **{{ git_revision_date_localized }}**

Once your Project Set has been provisioned, each Azure Subscription will be enrolled in the Azure Unified Support plan. There is a delay of approximately **2 weeks** for the Azure Unified Support plan to be activated.

> **Note:** If you use a third-party vendor's landing zone in Azure, you can't use the B.C. government's Unified Enterprise support plan for applications hosted in the vendor's landing zone.  
> 
> Ministry teams working in the OCIO-managed landing zone in Azure can currently access the Unified Enterprise support services for free.  

You can view the full list of services available to the ministries under the [Unified Enterprise support plan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-IN/microsoft-unified/plan-details){:data-proofer-ignore}.

New users may take up to 7 business days to gain access. If you need to open a support case before access is enabled, contact the OCIO Public cloud team at <cloud.pathfinder@gov.bc.ca>.
