Once your Project Set has been provisioned, each Azure Subscription will be enrolled in the Azure Unified Support plan.

> Note: There is a delay of approximately **2 weeks** for the Azure Unified Support plan to be activated.

In the Azure portal, you can search for Help + support to access the Azure Support Center and open a support ticket.
