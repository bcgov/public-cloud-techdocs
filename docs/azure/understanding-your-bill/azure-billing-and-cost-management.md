Azure Cost Management is a set of tools that help you manage and optimize your Azure costs. You can use Azure Cost Management to:

- Monitor your costs and usage
- Analyze cost drivers
- Optimize your spending

## Monitor your costs and usage

Azure Cost Management provides a dashboard that shows your costs and usage over time. You can see how much you're spending and where you're spending it. You can also see how your spending compares to your budget.

## Analyze cost drivers

Azure Cost Management helps you understand what's driving your costs. You can see which services are costing you the most money and which resources are using the most resources, using [cost reporting and analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/reporting-get-started).
